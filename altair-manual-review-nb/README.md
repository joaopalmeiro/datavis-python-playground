# Manual Review Notebook for Altair

This ([Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)) notebook (or template) aims to organize and standardize the necessary steps to test [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) charts manually. An example of a manual test is to check that the interactivity (panning, zooming, and tooltips, for example) is working as expected.
